graph teriminology:
    nodes are named vertices, and the cnnections between them are called edges
    two vertices are said to be adjacent if there exists a direct edge connecting them
    the degree of a node is defined as the number of edges that are incident to it
    a path is a collection of edges through which we can reach from one node to other in a graph
    a graoh is said to be connected if there is a path between every pair of vertices  
to find number of edges -> (N*(N-1)/2)
